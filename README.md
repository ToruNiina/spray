# Installation

It currently supports Linux only.

## Prerequisites

The following packages are required.

- C++14 compatible compiler
- CUDA 9 or later
- OpenGL 4.5 or later
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- git
- wget

## Depencency

spray depends on the following libraries.

- [png++](https://www.nongnu.org/pngpp/)
  - You can install it using your distribution's package manager (like `apt install libpng++-dev`).
  - It depends on libpng v1.2. If you manually install it, you might need to install `libpng12-dev` also.
- [glfw3](https://www.glfw.org/)
  - you can install it using your distribution's package manager (like `apt install libglfw3-dev`).
- [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
  - will automatically be cloned into `extlib/` by CMake.

  - will automatically be cloned into `extlib/` by CMake.
- [thrust](https://thrust.github.io/)
  - will be found `/path/to/cuda/include` after installing cuda.

## Build

To isolate stuff generated by building, I strongly recommend to make a `build/`
directory and run build script there.

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. # -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/compiler (optional)
$ make
```
